	<div id="about-me"class="about-me">
	<p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio page! My Name is Tom Merritt and I am an aspiring software developer looking to become a software developer apprentice! I have just left college studying a BTEC level 3 in software/games development and I am hoping to continue upon this career path through progression within an apprenticeship. </p>

		<p>Lets Take A Look At Some Of The Work I completed At College. Below is the logo and characters I created for the game that I designed and developed as part of a project at college.</p>

				<img class="game-player" src="game-player.gif">
				<img class="game-enemy" src="game-enemy.gif">
				<img class="game-hostage" src="game-hostage.png">
				<p>The game I created is a retro pixel art styled action stealth game where the player has to sneak past enemies without being caught and rescue all the hostages too! I drew my inspiration from the game series Splinter Cell. Lets take a look at some gameplay below.</p>
				<video muted controls><source src="gameplay-vid.mp4" type="video/mp4" >Cannot Load Video Sorry! </video>
				<p>Not too bad for a college project,huh? Below you will see some snippets of code from my game.</p>
				<img class="code-1" src="code-1.PNG"><br>
				<p>Above you can see a snippet of code that controls the player. For example when the user presses the W and D keys,(up and right for you righties), the sprite is changed corresponding to those key presses and the player will move at a speed of five diagonally to the right ,(45 degrees).</p>
				<img class="code-2" src="code-2.PNG">
				<p>Above you can see a snippet of code from the level three door. The Door checks the players score to make sure they have recued the hostage. If the player has recued the hostage and then collides with the door then they will be taken to the win screen of the game. If they haven't rescued the hostage then they wont be able to proceed. The other doors in the game have similar code except instead of taking the player to the win screen the player will be taken to the next level.</p>
